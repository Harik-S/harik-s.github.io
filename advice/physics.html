      <h2>How I got into Olympiads</h2> <p>I’m from the UK which doesn’t have a good Olympiad culture at all for Physics – the UKMT (Maths Olympiad) is all anyone really cares about and most students have already sent university applications before BPhO round 1 (the national Olympiad). The first piece of advice is to research national Olympiads early and ask your teachers or the person who needs to register you early – it would be quite annoying to do all of HRK and then not be able to participate.</p> <p>I personally began in June of Year 12 (Junior year/Grade 11, I was just under 17 years old when I started) which is quite late compared to a lot of people at IPhO. However, I still managed to get a Top Gold in Round 1, Gold in Round 2, as well as Gold in Astro Round 2. This qualified me for the selection camp where I was added to the team. From there, I got a silver, being a few avoidable errors off of a gold.</p> <h2>How did I prepare for Olympiads</h2> <p>I started with HRK, having already done most C1–C3 A level questions on <a href="https://isaacscience.org/">Isaac Science (formerly Isaac Physics)</a> which probably put me at a similar level knowledge-wise to the end of AP but with slightly better problem solving. I would definitely recommend it – it won’t get you up to IPhO but it will get you up to mid-HRK level and then you can just brush up on topics that aren’t covered well in the UK school system (e.g. EM waves, displacement current stuff, relativity, quantum, thermo) and you’ll be in a good place to start Kevin Zhou’s handouts.</p> <p>I would personally recommend not giving up on <em>any</em> question. Just record the questions you didn’t do in an Excel spreadsheet and come back to them when you feel like it. The handouts don’t really get that much harder – we had a question for M1 on the final zoom training session for IPhO. Don’t be discouraged if you can’t do certain questions, especially early on – there are certainly some questions I would seriously struggle with from the earlier handouts. Something I would recommend though is slightly mix up the order of topics – still bearing the prerequisites in mind. By IPhO, I felt slightly rusty in mechanics and that was certainly not good considering T2! However, lots of people in my position give very different advice on how to study so the key thing is to find what works for you.</p> <p>After Kevin Zhou, I worked on trying to do every IPhO and APhO paper (I DID!). This was pretty useful in terms of timings – I almost finished IPhO 2025 Theory – I probably could have with 10 more minutes, which is better than most competitors. Also some of these papers have mark schemes – not all of them. But that’s better than nothing. Make sure you know roughly how much working is good. You can talk to your TL’s when you get selected for IPhO.</p> <p>In terms of time, everyone is different, but by virtue of the UK school system only giving us 2 subjects for the last 2 years, I could spend a lot of time on this. I spent about 3 hours a day before my Oxford offer in mid-January. Then, it was about 5 until I got the selection for team. Then it went up to 7. Then I did 14 in the month before IPhO.</p> <p>There are a few caveats to this though – some days I didn’t feel like doing any physics. Also, if you start early, you don’t have to do this much.</p> <p>On the UK side, I got a 5 day (realistically 96 hours) selection camp with about 10 hours of practical and theory lectures that covered roughly HRK. I did HRK by August-ish 2024 so this was mainly just a chance to make sure I knew everything and relax from the practical. The theory test was 1 hour. It was pretty simple with the questions being very textbook-y. HRK would be enough to get on the UK team. After that, we had weekly zoom sessions for about 2 months before a 7 day (144 hour) training camp at Trinity College Cambridge. This was joint with the German team and had ~24 hours of past IPhO practical and some theory sessions.</p> <h2>I’ve been asked a lot about the maths prerequisite</h2> <p>Firstly, doing maths olympiads <em>did</em> help but not to the extent you think it might have. You can definitely get a gold at IPhO without having done particularly well on national Maths Olympiads. Also, the level of calculus required is:</p> <ul> <li>Differentiation and integration of standard functions (they will provide some integrals in IPhO, but it’s faster if you know them).</li> <li>Setting up integrals as sums of infinitesimal quantities.</li> <li>Differential equations and differentials.</li> </ul> <p>Most of this <strong>can</strong> be avoided and you can still do great — but it will be more natural if you can do this stuff without spending a long time.</p> <p>Differential equations are useful. I would recommend: separable, integrating factor, homogeneous and non-homogeneous second-order linear ODEs, and handling two simultaneous differential equations in two variables. This should cover every IPhO question. They will generally give you the solution to differential equations (e.g. see the preamble of 2023 T3 at <a href="https://apohub.pages.dev/ipho/2023/T3.pdf">https://apohub.pages.dev/ipho/2023/T3.pdf</a>).</p><p>\(df = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\,dx + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\,dy + \dots\) and be able to apply this (for example, by comparison to \(dU = T\,dS - p\,dV\), recognise that \(T = \frac{\partial U}{\partial S}\)) and (2) replace the d’s with Δ’s and use it to perform linear approximations. This is relatively uncommon in IPhO but has shown up.</p> <p><strong>This is what you NEED as a bare minimum.</strong> Of course, any extra you learn might help you in IPhO and definitely at uni in any STEM course — but the help will be small for IPhO and I would say that you can definitely get a gold with what I have given.</p> <h2>Is IPhO worth it?</h2> <p>Hmm I was totally questioning this at points in the selection process, especially while walking around Oxford at 10pm during the selection camp. But the experience at IPhO is amazing, even if you don’t get any medal or a HM, it is really fun.</p> <h2>I got a silver/bronze/HM and feel depressed. What do I do?</h2> <p>IPhO isn’t the be all and end all of life. Lots of people mess up on the day. Think about the Chinese competitor who got 76th. They were certainly an excellent physicist because you have to be to get anywhere close to the Chinese team but for whatever reason, he didn’t have a good IPhO. And that’s just life. When it comes down to 10 hours of exam after thousands of hours of practice, stuff happens. You’ll go really far in life if you were able to even get a medal in IPhO or even a HM, especially if you had the perseverance to grind through hours and hours of work – it’s more than a full time job for most of the year! I get this because I had it myself, scoring super high on past papers and then seeing the IPhO 2025 and going “oh no”. The important part of life is to keep going. If you enjoy physics, keep learning and getting better. If it wasn’t your day in the middle of July in some random country – that doesn’t change that you are amazing at physics.</p> <h2>How Much Calculus Should I Do?</h2> <p>Well, if you just care about doing well on IPhO, there are a few key skills you should learn — regardless of where you learn it.</p> <ul> <li>Differentiation and integration of standard functions, chain rule, product rule etc. (they will sometimes give integrals, but being fluent is faster).</li> <li>Being able to set up integrals (generally you won’t have multiple integrals in IPhO; clever coordinate choices can reduce integrals to one variable).</li> <li>Vector calculus is not necessary — you will normally use integral forms (e.g. Maxwell’s equations in integral form). If you want it, fine, but it’s not required.</li> <li>Differential equations: separable, integrating factors, homogeneous/non-homogeneous second-order linear ODEs, and two simultaneous ODEs should suffice.</li> <li>Learn differentials/partial derivatives enough to perform linear approximations and recognise when expressions behave like other, simpler expressions.</li> </ul>
