      <h2>Applying to the UK</h2> <p>I am definitely biased so take all this with a pinch of salt but I have heard some misconceptions about applying to the UK so I will clear all of that up.</p> <ul> <li>The tuition fees <em>are</em> a lot. You can look for loans/parental support/scholarships but this is probably the main hurdle to applying to the UK. I won’t give specific numbers because it varies a lot but it’s quite easy to find this information.</li> <li>You can apply to 5 universities. It doesn’t cost anything to apply to more universities so go crazy! You can’t, however, apply to Oxford <em>and</em> Cambridge and you can only apply to one course at each of those universities.</li> <li><strong>For Oxford and Cambridge, the personal statement really doesn’t matter much</strong>.* *except if you’re applying to do a humanities subject. O&C and Imperial to some extent mainly care about your entrance test and academics.</li> <li><strong>Apply early for your entrance test.</strong> Lots of the bookings open in August. You don’t want a 10 hour trip to a test centre, which is definitely possible in some countries around the world.</li> <li>The entrance process isn’t that hard for people doing Olympiads! HRK is enough to get about 90%+ on PAT (Oxford engineering and physics) and only about 10–15 people score that high and all of them get an offer (usually). The interview questions are also stuff olympiad students would love. One exception is ESAT (for Cambridge and Imperial Engineering and Natural Science/Physics/Chemistry courses) which relies more on speed than skill with questions that aren't particularly difficult, and you can look at ENGAA past papers to judge whether this would be to your advantage.</li> <li><strong>Don’t do an open application.</strong> You’ll end up at the college no one applies to. There’s a reason that’s true. You can totally apply for an undersubscribed college – but if there’s any college you have even a remote preference for, go for that.</li> <li>Mock interviews are useful but not essential. They’re not seeing how awkward or lack of awkward you are — I got 2 9/9s while being EXTREMELY awkward. They care about your physics (or whatever course you are applying to).</li> <li>Applying to UK universities doesn’t cost as much as US universities – even if you can’t definitely afford the fees, it might be worth considering applying.</li> </ul> <p>More data suggestions: <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/">https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/</a> — check this out for entrance tests statistics. You can’t request anything without being a British citizen/resident (not sure of the specifics) but you can browse a lot of data. Similarly, there’s a wide range of test papers for all tests. PAT also has admissions reports with lots of data.</p> <p><strong>Personal Statement ISN’T for ECs.</strong> See <a href="https://www.lucy.cam.ac.uk/supracurricular-exploration">https://www.lucy.cam.ac.uk/supracurricular-exploration</a> — this is the vibe of the stuff you need to include – not that you ran some high school club.</p> <p>Financial help is honestly not great. Due to a combination of factors, UK universities can’t give you the need-based scholarships etc. that US universities can. Except for certain specific, exclusive scholarships, you’re basically on your own. I would also encourage looking into other European universities. ETH, for example, isn’t anywhere near as oversubscribed or hard to get into as US universities — you don’t need a fancy essay (side note on ETH in particular: they only let you go to year 2 if you pass year 1 and the pass rate is ~50% so this is their “entrance test” if you will, which is definitely a big gamble). These universities will also have relatively lower fees, even if you are an international. tl;dr consider universities from every country.</p> <h2>More Advice — TSR</h2> <p>A long time ago in a past life (6 months ago) I gave advice to people (procrastinated olympiad prep) on a website called TSR. You can find it at <a href="https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/">https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/</a> though bear in mind that it is blocked in some countries. I would definitely recommend it for advice on BPhO and UK entrance exams, especially because the British community on PhODS (who are active) is relatively small. Anyways, here are some of my posts that might be particularly relevant to this audience:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/showthread.php?t=7566351&p=100280029">ESAT and how to prepare for it</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/showthread.php?t=7576091&p=100400835">Why I went Oxford over Cambridge for Engineering</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/showthread.php?t=7571232&p=100335266">Why you don't NEED a tutor for maths</a> (you can dm me if you still want one)</li> <li><a href="https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/showthread.php?t=7556955&p=100186537">Answers to some questions about the logistics of Pearson VUE testing</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/showthread.php?t=7556051&p=100186537">Debunking the myths about Oxbridge being prohibitively hard to get into</a> (main takeaway: normal people go to Oxford and Cambridge!)</li> <li><a href="https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/showthread.php?t=7540869">Good ESAT prep advice</a></li> </ul>
