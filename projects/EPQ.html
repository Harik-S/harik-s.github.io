      <p>This project was about sustainable aircraft design and was in 2 parts. The first involved researching various things, with full analysis and evaluation
        of sources. The second part was a design project, where I modified wing design and tried to optimise for sustainability. I used SolidWorks CFD. However, in the
        conclusions, I discussed improvements including Bayesian Optimisation and Ansys + SolidWorks API. The method used was grid search and this resulted in very slow
        runs, because varying 5 or so different parameters across 20 different values gives a very large number of combinations. This could be used alongside other tools to 
        optimise even better. The full report can be found <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/rus0hzmajxiiygh6gviq2/EPQ-latest.docx?rlkey=3p2r6k97mbjsp2e2g5nfl2u68&st=1uxl63ix&dl=0">here</a>.
