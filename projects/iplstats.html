        In this project, I made a Python project to score an IPL fantasy game. As you can see above, the scoring system is very complex, and there is no good API. 
        This is mainly because of commercial reasons related to ESPNCricinfo. So, I had to scrape the data from the website. Partway through the project, ESPNCricinfo changed their 
        security to prevent scraping, so I had to switch techniques. For more details on code, see the GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/Harik-S/iplstats">here</a>. This was my 
        first experience with web scraping and I learnt a lot about HTML, especially on the other side - extracting data rather than designing a website.
