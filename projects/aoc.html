      <p>Welcome to my Advent of Code solutions! Here, I will share my solutions and thought processes for each day's challenge. I will aim to update this 
      page daily during the Advent of Code event so please stay away from this page if you don't want spoilers.</p>

      <h2>2024</h2>
      <p>This was the first year I seriously participated. I learned a lot about problem-solving and algorithm design. I mainly used Python and got 47/50 stars. I don't have the solutions available but in future years, I will add them to this page.</p>
